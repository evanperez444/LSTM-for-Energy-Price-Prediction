# LSTM-for-Energy-Price-Prediction

- This project is a notebook that utilizes a recurrent neural network to forecast the price of energy consumption of homes in Spain.
- Long Short Term Memory is explored in this notebook, including other variations of LSTM (attention,bidirectional, CNN)
- In addition to energy consumption, weather data is included for our forecast. This will be a multivariate LSTM model
